# GifTastic


In this assignment, the GIPHY API was used to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of popular Netflix shows. To finish this task, the GIPHY API was called and and  JavaScript and jQuery was used to change the HTML of your site.

<h2>Netflix Shows!</h2>


<h3>App Organization</h3>
<p>Here's how the app works:</p>

This app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.

A loop appends a button for each string in the array.


When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.


When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates. If the user clicks the gif again, it stops playing.


Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

This data is provided by the GIPHY API.
